Realfagsbiblioteket
=========

PhoneGap-based app (Android, iOs) for searching and navigating the UiO Science Library. 
Licensed under the MIT license.

Note that only the Android project files are currently in the repo.
Building for iOs currently involves copying the files over to another directory
holding the Xcode project files, but were planning to move to Cordova 3 soon, which
provides a nifty command line based build process for both platforms so we don't have
to keep the projects in sync manually.
